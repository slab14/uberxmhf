# uber eXtensible Micro-Hypervisor Framework (uberXMHF)

## Introduction

The uber eXtensible Micro-Hypervisor Framework (uberXMHF)
is a formally verifiable micro-hypervisor framework 
which forms the foundation for a new class of (security-oriented) 
micro-hypervisor based applications ("uberapps") on commodity computing platforms.

uberXMHF currently runs on both x86 (Intel and AMD) and ARM (Raspberry PI) 
multi-core hardware virtualized platforms.
The framework is capable of running unmodified legacy multiprocessor 
capable OSes such as Windows and Linux.  

Visit: <http://uberxmhf.org> for more information on how to download, 
build, install, contribute and get involved.

The formatted documentation can 
be read online at: <http://uberxmhf.org/docs/toc.html>

Documentation sources are within `docs/` and can be built using
`make clean` followed by `make docs_html` within the `docs/` folder.
Note that you will need a working installation of sphinx to build
the documentation within your development environment. For example, 
within Ubuntu/Debian distributions the following will install sphinx:

`sudo apt install python3-pip`
`python3 -m pip install sphinx==2.2.0`
`python3 -m pip install sphinx-jsondomain==0.0.3`

uberSpark (<http://uberspark.org>) is used to build and verify 
security invariants of uberXMHF.
