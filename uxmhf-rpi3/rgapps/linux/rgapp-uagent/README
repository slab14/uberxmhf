guest app for demonstrating use of uberapp that encrypts a data blob.

Includes 2 example programs:
- demo which has the hypervisor encrypt and decrypt a variable.
- a simple "chat" program (server/client) encrypts data prior to sending and decrypts upon receiving using shared symmetric secret key in hypervisor (AES encryption). Note: the chat program assumes that server is bound to an IP of 10.1.1.2
