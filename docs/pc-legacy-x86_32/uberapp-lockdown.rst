title: Lockdown uberApp
-----------------------

Introduction
------------

Lockdown provides the user with a red/green system: an isolated and
constrained environment for performing online transactions, as well as
a high-performance, general-purpose environment for all other
(non-security-sensitive) applications. An external device verifies
which environment is active and allows the user to securely learn
which environment is active and to switch between them.

The original design and implementation of Lockdown is described in:

  Applications on Commodity Platforms.  Amit Vasudevan and Bryan Parno

The implementation of Lockdown contained herein can be via the
core build process (see :doc:`Building uberXMHF (pc-legacy-x86_32) <{% link docs/pc-legacy-x86_32/verify-build>`\ ). Note that the implementation 
is a **\ *research prototype*\ ** and does not yet fully provide the 
security properties of the design.
